With this ftplugin you can type "create table foo (foo_id int);" and get "CREATE TABLE foo (foo_id INT);".  It is based on both sql.vim and the output from postgresql's \dT command while in psql.  That makes it a tad bit tailored to postgresql, but it will work with any SQL compliant dbms. 

I probably won't upload every update I make immediately so the most current version may be found on github.

earlier versions of this plugin are here http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=305 I am unable to contact Michael Brailsford so have forked the script with my changes. Changes have currently amounted to adding reserved words that weren't present.
